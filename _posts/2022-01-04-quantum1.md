Quantum physics to me was always this mystifying property which gave unreal capabilities to subatomic particles.
I mean come on, teleportation? Being in two places at once? Seems science fiction to me. Now if you aren’t aware of quantum mechanics, basically electrons or any other subatomic particle have some wacky but neat super powers such as superposition, (the power to be a wave and a particle, at the same time) quantum tunnelling, (the power to bypass any barriers i.e move through walls) entanglement (the power to be psychic, like having a twin where if one is affected then simultaneously so is the other).

Neat, huh? Unfortunately us humans don’t have these super powers so these forces never really affect us or matter in the classical physics world.

Or so I thought.
