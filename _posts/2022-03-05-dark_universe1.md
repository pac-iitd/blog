Whatever you can see, whatever you can feel around you, the air, the water. Even the molecules, from subatomic particles like quarks and electrons to the large galactic clusters in the universe. All matter together add up to only 5% of the total universe. All beautiful physics that humanity has uncovered, was solely based on the knowledge of this 5%. All known physics, contained in this tiny fraction, a small trailer to the whole movie. But why haven’t we discovered the rest yet? To put it simply, the dark universe is like an unsolved crime case. You know the crime has happened. You also observe the clues, but you don’t know who did it or how it happened.

## How the whole “dark matter” business started

Going back hundreds of years in history, there have been numerous ideas and discussions about a so-called “missing mass”, or “invisible matter”. In 1884, in a talk given by Lord Kelvin (Yes, the one after which the temperature scale is named), he used the velocity dispersion of the stars orbiting about the center of the Milky Way to estimate the mass of the galaxy, which he determined is different compared to the total mass of visible stars, and concluded that many of our stars may be “dark bodies”. It was in the early 1930s that the existence of dark matter could be numerically inferred. A Swiss astrophysicist by the name of Fritz Zwicky, who was surveying galaxy clusters at the time, discovered that the mass of all the stars in the cluster accounted for only 1% of what was needed to keep the galaxies from escaping the cluster’s gravitational pull.

But we’re not here to discuss history. We’re scientists! We’re interested in logical explanations and solid proofs! So how exactly did we come to a concrete conclusion that this stuff does in fact exist and is not just some sci-fi concept? 

## Identifying dark matter through its effects on the universe

In 1939, American astronomer Horace W. Babcock studied the andromeda nebula, which suggested that the mass/luminosity ratio increases as we go radially outward. The abnormality was finally confirmed in the 1970s, when American astronomers Vera Rubin and W. Kent Ford confirmed the observations of Babcock for a general galaxy; the mass of stars visible within a general galaxy is only about 10% of that needed to keep the stars orbiting the galaxy’s center (The huge difference between Zwicky’s and Rubin’s observations were due to an obsolete value of the Hubble constant in earlier years). In fact, the tangential speed of such an orbit is independent of their orbital radius i.e. it remains constant as we move away from the galaxy (in some cases it may even increase slightly). Ideally, it should have dropped off as we moved further away.

This observation was proof that the mass of the galaxy within the orbit of a star increases linearly as we go away from the center. Yet, no light is seen from this extra mass (hence the increase in mass/luminosity ratio). So what’s going on?

Vera Rubin, following Zwicky, postulated this missing structure as dark matter. As time went on, more and more evidence suggesting the existence of such a quantity started pouring out. One such phenomena is Gravitational Lensing, a consequence of general relativity, which says that massive objects, lying between a distant source and an observer, acts as a “lens” and bends the light emitted from this source. The more massive an object, the more bending/lensing is observed. How does dark matter come into play? Well, you see, the data that is obtained through telescopes shows lensing, even in empty space. How is it possible that gravity exists in a completely empty region of space, where there is no visible mass? Dark matter could be the only possible explanation!

However, there is no visible mass that could produce lensing on such a large scale, suggesting a presence of dark matter in that chunk of space

## Okay, dark matter does exist, but how?

There is currently a huge international effort to try to identify and explain the nature of dark matter. One theory is that dark matter is actually made up of subatomic particles which are as of yet unidentified. They are of a type completely different from baryonic matter (which is just ordinary matter, built up of protons and neutrons). One such candidate for a dark matter particle is the WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle). These are assumed to have been produced in the early universe. Broadly speaking, a WIMP is a particle which interacts with other particles solely via gravity, (or also through weak nuclear force) and no other force. These particles are also hypothesized to have a large mass as compared to other particles. As a consequence of this large mass, their velocities would be relatively slow, and hence they would be “cold”. Since these particles do not interact with electromagnetic fields, they are essentially invisible (visibility of course referring to light).

Keep in mind, the convention of “hot” or “cold” is not at all related to temperature. Rather it refers to velocity, indicating how far corresponding objects moved due to random motions in the early universe, before they slowed due to cosmic expansion. This distance is called the free streaming length (FSL). A good analogy to FSL would be the mean free path, commonly seen in gas theory. Dark matter particles are classified as cold, warm, or hot according to their FSL. Larger the FSL, “hotter” the dark matter particle.

Another theory that could prove the existence of a particle is supersymmetry. In a supersymmetric theory, the equations for force and the equations for matter are identical (this is a very crude description of supersymmetry. It is actually much more complex). Many forms of supersymmetric theories exist; each one being an extension to a topic in physics, such as quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, optics, statistical mechanics, etc. In the context of particle physics, a consequence of this theory is that for each particle in the standard model, a supersymmetric partner particle (superpartner) exists, which has an ”unbroken” (complete) symmetry to the particle, i.e. it has the same mass and quantum numbers, except spin. However the contribution of supersymmetry to dark matter is in the form of a supersymmetric particle. Described as the lightest supersymmetric particle, this particle can serve as a candidate for WIMP.

## How can we directly detect it instead of looking for its effects?

Astronomers believe that WIMPs show the property of self-annihilation when colliding with each other, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of gamma rays, neutrinos, protons, electrons, etc. As a consequence, they have searched the vast vacuums of space hoping to detect traces of events that could have been produced by these collisions, but to no avail so far.

Experiments in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN constantly try to discover new particles, hoping that the results could prove the existence of many new kinds of particles (the most recent discovery was the Higgs boson, detected in the LHC back in 2012). Supersymmetric particles are a part of these experiments, and scientists are constantly looking for these particles everyday. Unfortunately, any kind of supersymmetric particles have not yet been found.

## Could we be wrong?

As celebrated as dark matter may be, there are some bold people that have tried to oppose the existence of dark matter altogether. One such postulation is the so-called Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). The idea behind this is that gravity behaves differently over long distances, compared to its behavior locally. This difference of behavior explains phenomena such as rotation curves of galaxies. Nevertheless, it fails to account for the behavior and movement of matter in very large structures with even larger distances, such as galaxy clusters. Many such theories that oppose the existence of dark matter have failed in some or the other way. That’s why so many people believe so strongly in dark matter, and that there is no explanation that could disprove it.

## What’s next…?

Let us say that one fine day, a successful theory of dark matter can be cooked up. Say we could now manipulate dark matter, and learn to harness it. What now? Well, there are a lot of uses that one can think of. Earlier we mentioned that WIMPs are believed to show self-annihilation. This could be useful when we have to produce a lot of energy in a very short amount of time, such as an energy reactor. If this self-annihilation could somehow be controlled, it could even be used as an alternative to rocket fuel. This way, we wouldn’t have to worry about fuel running out, since dark matter is quite literally everywhere!

However, there may be an even bigger implication than near-infinite fuel. We know that dark matter can interact with normal matter through gravity. Manipulating the density of dark matter could potentially mean manipulating its gravity, and manipulating gravity would be - to put it simply - the biggest breakthrough in physics in a very long time. To do it justice, the topic would require its very own article! But let’s not go down that rabbit hole. 

Now keep in mind, these applications are just related to the effects we have seen so far. Who knows what more can be brought to light through the dark universe?
