Life has sprung to extraordinary complexity on earth, resisting disorder and harsh environments. But are we the only ones in this vast universe?


## Silent Sentients: Exploring Extraterrestrial Life

We look up at the sky and wonder- can there be other intelligent species like us? If yes, what would they be they made of? What kind of exotic worlds would  they live in? What kind of natural phenomena would have shaped their bodies, and what kind of skies and sunrises would they get to see? How deep are their oceans and due to deep sea gigantism, which says that species which are in deep sea environments may be larger than their shallow sea counterparts, what monsters may lurk underneath these immensely deep oceans.

Astrobiology, biophysics and observational astronomy aim to answer these questions. The Drake equation (although highly controversial and conjectural), predicts a very high probability of finding radio communicable intelligent life yet there is currently no clear visible sign of life anywhere. It appears as though life is only a terrestrial phenomenon. 

>WHAT IS LIFE AND WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

NASA defines life to be a “self-sustaining chemical system that is capable of Darwinian evolution”. It can in general be very difficult to define what exactly life is, but these are some characteristics of terran life:
- Chemical in essence. Living systems contain chemicals which undergo chemical transformation, the resulting energy change is utilized by the system to do work, move around molecules/build up newer molecules/break them apart, etc. These biomolecules take advantage of the thermodynamics of the covalent bond and the chemistry of the elements carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, trace minerals, etc. These require liquid water, as water acts as a polar solvent allowing interesting things to happen.
- Manifests in the form of membrane bound entities called cells. This serves to isolate the inner chemical machinery from the outer world. This is done to preserve order and avoid any sort of unregulated or unintended mass transfer into or out of the cell, creating local bodies of order. Life can be said to be that phenomenon which minimizes local entropy, or thrives on an energy gradient.
- Have machinery/molecules to store genetic information, which is prone to variation as the cell makes a copy of itself, which is the basis for Darwinian selection.
The search for extraterrestrial life is usually carried out by looking for some of the more important molecules and elements of life, radical disturbances in the chemical composition of the planet’s surface or atmosphere, or making some guesses by looking at the kind of energy the planet receives from its star and satellites.

## Where To Find Them?
 
### Earth-like terrestrial planets/moons or comets/asteroids/meteors

While on the hunt for life on earth-like planets/moons, scientists generally see if the planet lies in the goldilocks zone. It would also suffice if the chemical system that is 
life receives enough energy input to keep it sustained and allow for its manifestations to change the chemical compositions of molecules around and within 	themselves. Glycine deposits were found in the 1971 Murchison meteorite, phosphorus deposits in the atmosphere of the comet of 67P. Meteors and other 
space rocks move around these essential biomolecules across space, somewhat 
analogous to bees moving around pollen to pollinate flowers. NASA’s TESS mission 
keeps on the lookout for potential exoplanets which may be a havens of life teeming with complex organisms. 

Detection of "signs of life" is currently done by noting details like liquid water in the atmosphere, which shows that the temperature is just right for the survival of organisms. Another indicator would be oxygen in the atmosphere of these planets. Chemical compositional analysis is thus integral for the search of life on planets, which is undertaken by methods such as spectroscopy. Complex computer models have been invented to keep track of the various spectra of the elements and compounds. 


### Frozen worlds:
Frozen worlds can refer to outcast planets, kicked out of their orbits by interesting gravitational phenomena, or their star being so far away that the warmth doesn’t reach the surface in sufficient amounts. They are detected by auroral emissions which result either from the planet passing through interstellar plasma, or from the moons of these planets as they zip past through fields of plasma trapped in that planet’s magnetic field. The energy to the chemical system that is life comes through tidal forces of any satellites they bring along with them, or from the geothermal energy because of the dynamo effect of the core of the planet, which helps to move around energy and matter. Alkaline hydrothermal vents may accelerate the process, the primitive life feeding off the energy gradient caused by mixing of alkaline discharge from the vents and the acidic liquid water beneath the icy crust. As time passes, the manifestations of life – the cell, grows more and more complex and may organize to form colonies or larger bodies. Darwinian selection may then take hold and steer life to increasing complexity. There is no telling what kind of crazy monsters we can find underneath the frozen icy crust.

### Taking a step back
We have taken it for granted that life is entirely carbon based. For instance when viking I first landed on mars, it had tools only to probe for C-14 radioactive isotope of carbon. It’s a possibility that life can be so different from what we imagined that traditional methods of detecting biosignatures may fail to give a clear indication. NASA  defines life to be a chemical system that is driven by natural selection, but there are some scientists who have even conceived of “supra-darwinian” pathways. We are sometimes rigorously primed to think and theorize in the scope of observation and existing theories that we sometimes tend to dismiss off radically new observations and thoughts. This “theory laden ness of observation” is probably being overstated a little, but it also helps sometimes to think out of the box.

For instance, many sci-fi shows like Star Trek have questioned the possibility of silicon based life. Given the abundance of silicon, it is natural to wonder if some extremophiles employed organo-silicon compounds. Scientists artificially got living cells to make carbon-silicon bonds. Directed evolution of cytochrome-c was used to achieve carbon silicon bonds. These new molecules may be the connecting link between ordinary carbon based life and more bizarre silicon based life forms. This cytochrome-c is a heme protein which was artificially selected to catalyse carbon and silicon bond formation. This phenomena is not observed anywhere on earth naturally, but the sheer grandeur of the universe forces us to question about such partial, or even incorporation of silicon by the agents of life, the cell.

Bacteria which metabolise sulphur exist today in deep sea hydrothermal vents. They use sulphur for their energy needs. There is a minor possibility that adverse selection pressures may drive these bacteria to incorporate sulphur in their biochemistry. Sulphur is also able to form long chains like carbon, but is unable to undergo extensive branching like carbon. Also there is a possibility that microorganisms may reduce H2S instead of H2O for metabolism. 

Finally, all there is to say is, the universe is extremely large, and we cannot even begin to fathom the different kinds of biologies of the agents of life that may embody, they may range from large monsters with an unconceivable physiology to small microorganisms exploiting their environment to the fullest. Life is a wonderful and marvellous phenomenon that may even spring up even where we would sometimes least expect it.
