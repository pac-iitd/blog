This is a template that can be used as a reference for formatting. 


## Special formatting

As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:

+ **bold**
+ *bold*
+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*
+ [link](www.github.com)


## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<li class="ml-1 mr-1">
    <a target="_blank" href="#">
    <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
    </a>
</li>
```

#### Python

```python
print("Hello World")
```


## Rendering Images

## Videos, pdfs etc (Iframes)

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:


<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kL_JnD2PxJI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
