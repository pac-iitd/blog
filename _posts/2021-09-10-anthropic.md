The Anthropic Principle states that “if the universe weren't suitable for life, we would not ask why in the first place."  In his world-renowned book, A brief history of time, Stephen Hawking paraphrases anthropic principle as- “we see the Universe the way it is because we exist!” At first glance, it may seem a philosophical or pseudo-science concept. It does, however, help understand quite a few mysteries of the Universe. In this post, you will be able to appreciate and demystify some interesting interpretations of this principle, along with a peek at its possible practical, theoretical, and perhaps controversial implications.

## Respect Causality 

One common misinterpretation of this principle is that the fundamental laws of the Universe are somehow influenced or even governed by our existence. If we had existed in some other form (perhaps silicon or helium), then the laws of nature would change. Although there is some truth in such statements, the causality is reversed. 

Our existence is not the cause of the Universe being in a particular state, but instead the effect. Also, this is not a one-to-one mapping, i.e. there may be different configurations of the Universe that allow our existence. Our existence is simply an experimental observation, and the Universe’s state, a plausible hypothesis. Different observations need different hypotheses to be explained, but the observations do not “cause” the hypothesis. 

## Quantum Observations

An analogy with the anthropic principle can be observations in quantum mechanics. It is a common phenomenon that whenever a quantum system is observed, its wave function collapses and it assumes a particular state. Thus, the act of observing may seem to be influencing the system. One might take inspiration from Hawking’s paraphrase and say that “we see the state of the quantum system the way it is because we observed”. One might even generalise this to say that the entire Universe is a quantum system in superposition, and when a person observes his/her existence, it causes the Universal wave function to collapse. 

Although these ideas may or may not be true, they can neither be proved nor disproved by the anthropic principle. A quantum system collapses because of interacting with its environment (mostly through light), whenever an observation is made. Thus, quantum observation may only be a good analogy for the anthropic principle, and may not have any physical connection. 

## Multiverse Theory

The anthropic principle is often associated with the Multiverse theory, and faces similar criticism too. Since every possible form of existence should necessitate a particular state of the Universe, shouldn’t there be a separate universe where any “possible” form of existence is actually observed? Shouldn't there be a separate Universe for every Manga ever written? What is “possible”? Anything impossible in this Universe may as well be commonplace in another. Although the anthropic principle may be explained if these ideas are correct, it does not imply them. 

Let’s try to go through a simple example to see why. Imagine rolling a simple, cosmologically insignificant, 6 sided die. There are, as always, 6 possible outcomes of the roll, each with equal probability. Now, one might think that each outcome should have a corresponding Universe attached with it, and that rolling the simple, innocent die would make the all-encompassing Universe split into 6 distinct ones. Although this might be the case, one cannot use the anthropic principle for explaining this. The anthropic principle only guarantees a Universe where each outcome is “possible”, and the original Universe already satisfies this, with no need for new ones. Thus, using this principle alone is not sufficient. Although it may be evidence in favour of the Multiverse theory, the anthropic principle does not imply it.

## Implications

Now that we have seen what this elegant principle does not imply, let's dive into what it actually does.

The anthropic principle explains how the Universe seems to be so delicately fine-tuned for us. A slight mis-balance in the ratio of particles to anti-particles, the relative strengths of the electromagnetic and gravitational forces or the relative masses of the proton and electron, may have been enough to never allow our existence. The anthropic principle explains this using contradiction in a simple and elegant way. It says that if the balance were off, we would not have been here to complain! Thus, in some sense, it uses information about the current state of the Universe to restrict the possibilities of the past. A wonderful example for this is the prediction about the structure of the carbon nucleus made by Fred Hoyle in 1952 (more [here](https://www.britannica.com/science/anthropic-principle)). 

This simple principle also makes the search for extraterrestrial life more challenging. A common approach to finding alien life is to search for exoplanets with similar conditions as earth. But since these conditions are only needed for carbon-based life to exist, there may be many other planets with other conditions that may be missed.

The anthropic principle is a simple, yet elegant statement. Bordering on philosophy, it is subject to many interpretations and corresponding implications. To finish off, one may want to think about a different toy principle: “The anthropic principle is as interesting as it is because you read about it?”
