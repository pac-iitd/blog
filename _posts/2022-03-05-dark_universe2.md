Whatever you can see, whatever you can feel around you, the air, the water. Even the molecules, from subatomic particles like quarks and electrons to the large galactic clusters in the universe. All matter together add up to only 5% of the total universe. All beautiful physics that humanity has uncovered, was solely based on the knowledge of this 5%. All known physics, contained in this tiny fraction, a small trailer to the whole movie. But why haven’t we discovered the rest yet? To put it simply, the dark universe is like an unsolved crime case. You know the crime has happened. You also observe the clues, but you don’t know who did it or how it happened.

Do you know why you have two eyes? Let us imagine what would happen if we could see from only one of our eyes. We would have seen the world as if it was 2-dimensional. I am sure that just now you have tried it, but are disagreeing, saying “No, I can still see the 3-dimensional world!”. The point I am trying to make is that the things you are looking at are already known to your mind, and it has already created its perspective in 3-D about these things, but if you look at a completely new object, something that has never been seen before, you will see that the statement is in fact true!

## Where did all of it begin?

The history of dark energy is as old as the age of the universe itself i.e. dark energy was always there since the beginning of time itself - The Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago (have you ever wondered how or why it has happened?). Yet we started suspecting it only two decades ago. The term "DARK ENERGY" was first coined by cosmologist Michael Turner in 1998. In 1999, a team of scientists was studying the redshift of the distinct supernovae, to calculate the rate of expansion of the universe. They predicted that the rate of expansion should decrease due to the gravitational attraction at large scales and intuition, but as we know - the universe is full of surprises. It surprises you when you expect it the least. The results showed that instead of going down, the expansion is accelerating! At that time almost all physicists believed that there must be some experimental error or some calculation mistake. However it is not a calculation mistake, and in the end, they all had to accept the fact - “The biggest truth of the universe, they knew nothing about it at all”. This was one of the greatest groundbreaking discoveries in the history of mankind and brought the Nobel prize in physics in 2011 for Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt, and Adam G. Riess for their leadership.

The universe kept on expanding after the big bang, at an accelerating rate!



## What actually is Dark Energy?

As you would have guessed in the above paragraph, Dark Energy is somewhat connected to the acceleration of the expanding universe, and you are indeed right. To put it in one sentence - Dark Energy is a kind of repulsive force. If you want to know how we get the mathematical equation, then I suppose you must have heard of General Relativity ("Matter tells space how to curve, space tells matter how to move" – John Wheeler). In the full field equation of General Relativity(GR), there was a term called the Cosmological term. Einstein added the term in the full field equations of GR after one year from the theory was published in 1916, since without it, the equation wasn’t obeying Mach’s principle (In one capsule, Mach’s principle is - “If there is no matter then there is no geometry of space-time”) and it gave the solution for the Einstein Static Universe. In 1929, after Hubble's discovery of the expanding universe, Einstein discarded the cosmological term from his equation stating it was the biggest blunder he ever made. Nonetheless, around 70 years later this chapter again came into action, by the discovery of the acceleration of the expanding universe. We think of vacuum as some sort of a void space in which there isn’t anything, but recent experiments suggest that vacuum(free space) is not empty at all. It contains a very very tiny amount of energy within itself! To put it in one simple sentence - The cosmological term tells you about the free space energy (vacuum energy). It is this vacuum energy that gives the repulsion effect to the universe. Although the energy is small, the fact that the universe is so big and empty means that all this energy adds up together and dominates over the gravitational attraction at a large scale.

## The concept of Multiverse and String Theory 

As this energy is attached to space itself, quantum theories have predicted a value that is 10^120 (120 zeros after 1) more than the observed one. This is the biggest discrepancy in the order of magnitudes in the history of physics ever! The problem seems to be resolved from two completely different ideas of physics - 1. String Theory, and 2. The Multiverse.
In 1979, Alan Guth and Alexei Starobinsky proposed the model of inflation in which (GR predictions) gravity could act in the opposite manner resulting in an exponential expansion (the bang) of the universe for a very tiny amount of time (of order 10^-36 sec) and after that, it starts to slow down. A couple of years later, other physicists like Andrei Linde and Alexander Vilenkin came up with the idea of eternal inflation. As it's reasonable if it can happen once, then why not several times? This theory says that inflation never stopped, and is still going on, giving birth to other bangs (The Multiverse).

Currently, we have discovered that subatomic particles like protons and neutrons are made up of even tinier particles like quarks. String theory suggests that these smaller particles are made up of even smaller vibrating strings. Think of it as a circular loop and in this loop you can form standing modes of several different orders. Now the way these strings vibrate determines the nature of the particle. The problem with this theory is it works in ‘9 spatial’ dimensions. Now to imagine this I have already given you an example, in the beginning. Let's take one more. Imagine there is a kite flying in the sky. Now if you are far away from the kite then you can see only the kite but if you go closer then you will find that there is a thread attached to it and if you go even further close then you will found that the thread is not 1-D, its cylindrical type i.e. it has another dimension. Similarly, if you could go at a billion or a trillion times smaller than the radius of that thread you will find that there are extra dimensions curled up in space. The shape of these extra dimensions determines how the string will vibrate, and the vibration determines the fundamental property of the particle. It turns out that string theory gives 10^500 different possible shapes of these extra dimensions, each equally probable. You can think of every single shape as a kind of DNA of a particular universe.

## How is all this connected? 

Now if you see all these completely different theories together, then all things which seemed to be unreasonable, start seeming to be perfect. String theory predicts 10^500 different possible shapes, corresponding to different universes. Each universe has its own value for dark energy, and the value that is predicted from quantum theory could be the value of one of those universes, as the number of possibilities are incredibly larger than the discrepancy (10^500 possibilities as compared to the discrepancy of 10^120 !).  

## The war over the control of the universe

Since the beginning of the Universe, there has been a war going on over the control of the universe between the two very fundamental powers, Dark Energy and Dark Matter. As now you know that dark matter attracts things and dark energy repels. This causes these fundamental forces to become each other’s enemy. According to experimental observations, it is found that the rate of expansion was decreasing for the initial 8 billion years (app.) and that it started to accelerate after that. Since then, it has never stopped and it seems that it's never going to stop at all. Now the reason why this happened is hidden in the strength density of dark energy in the free space. As I have said, its effect is very very weak because its density (mass-energy equivalence) comes out to be (experimentally) of the order of 10^-27 (kg/m^3), very very low. So when the universe was small at the beginning of time, dark matter dominated over this low energy, but as it expanded, dark energy took control of the war from dark matter, and it seems that dark energy is on her inevitable march of winning this war. As the universe expands, dark energy is going to dominate more and more in such a manner that it may tear everything apart - the planets, stars, from atoms to even black holes. Physicists call this THE BIG CHILL (not the one from Ben10).
